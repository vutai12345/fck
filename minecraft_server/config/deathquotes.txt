Gamers don't die, they respawn!
IT APPEARS YOU${{next_line}}HAVE REACHED${{next_line}}AN END.
WILL YOU TRY AGAIN?
WILL YOU PERSIST?
I'm going to kill you, and THEN kill you again.
I imagine death so much, it feels more like a memory
You cannot give up just yet... ${{player_name}}! Stay determined...
Aw shucks... you did the classic!
Hopefully you don't need to travel awhile!
Sayonara! For now...
Can you even fight?
Raspberry Flavoured is not responsible for any deaths and/or loss of items
Come on, you can do better than that!
Try harder... more harder!
Skill issue
Krill issue
Hopefully you didn't get horribly mutilated!
You are really not made for this, huh?
OK, I'll believe in you this time, don't die!
I don't think it's THAT difficult... right?
You blundered it!
Worse than slipping on a banana peel, for sure!
Why are you so naive?
Shape up!
Well, it seems that your journey has ended. Very sorry about that.
Respawn yourself, NOW!

You're a deathkisser

Go, go! If you can't do it, no one can!
Raspberry Flavoured is really not that difficult, I think...
I hope your item totem somehow despawns.
Next time, be prepared!
You fool! Ya did it again!
Does death hurt? Maybe, but you probably won't feel it... actually, maybe you WILL feel the impact BEFORE you died, but... whatever, just keep playing
That one really knocked your socks off!
WAAAAAAAAHHHHH
So long, gay Bowser!
SURPRISE!
Did you want death for your birthday? Well, you're welcome!
Death happens eventually - you just sped up the process!
WASTED
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.
... you're gonna blame this one on a glitch, aren't you?
Silliness is tolerated, and you showcased it!
Do better next time... if there is one...
Raz spent ages adding these, thanks for dying so you can see our blood, sweat and tears!
Get off Minecraft for the day, you need it.
It looks like you got your head handed to you. So, how about giving it another shot?
Thank you for choosing... exotic butters

FISSION MAILED
You seem to be worn out from fighting. One more time?
You're right, terrible - let's try that again!
Maybe try peaceful mode?
This is NOT epic!
This is not your fate...!
Please, don't give up!
Come on, that all you got!? ${{player_name}}, get up...!
You beefed it!
Better luck next time, boss!
Breathe in... breathe out...
