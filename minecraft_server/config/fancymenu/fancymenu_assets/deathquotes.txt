IT APPEARS YOU HAVE REACHED AN END.
WILL YOU TRY AGAIN?
WILL YOU PERSIST?
I imagine death so much, it feels more like a memory!
You cannot give up just yet... 
Stay determined...
Sayonara!
Come on, you can do better than that!
Try harder... more harder!
Skill issue!
Well, it seems that your journey has ended. 
Very sorry about that.
Respawn yourself, NOW!
gg no re
You're a deathkisser!
let's just get to the point.
Next time, be prepared!
Does death hurt?
That one really knocked your socks off!
So long, gay Bowser!
SURPRISE!
WASTED
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.
Do better next time... if there is one.
Get off Minecraft for the day, you need it.
It looks like you got your head handed to you. 
So, how about giving it another shot?
Thank you for choosing... exotic butters
TOO BAD.
Oh no! ... anyway
Oops, you have to put the CD in your computer!
PRESS 'R' TO TRY AGAIN
In this world, it's kill or be killed!
YOU ARE DEAD. NOT BIG SURPRISE.
It's joever
YOU'RE FINISHED!
... and that's all she wrote!
That's all, folks!
Mamma mia, a-here I go again!
Snake? Snake!? SNAAAAAKE!!
The end is never the end!
MAMAAAAAAAAA, I DON'T WANNA DIE
FISSION MAILED
One more time?
You're right, terrible - let's try that again!
Maybe try peaceful mode?
This is NOT epic!
This is not your fate...!
Please, don't give up!
Come on, that all you got!?
You beefed it!
Better luck next time, boss!
Breathe in... breathe out...
Check your pulse!
You blacked out!
GOD DAMN IT
We all fail, we all make mistakes, it's what makes us human.
Oof!

Just be glad you're not on Bedrock Edition.
Hope you weren't playing on hardcore mode!
This is all just a bad dream... and you're NEVER waking up!
Close your eyes, you'll be here soon
[Die Now] AND I'LL THROW IN [50] [Bullets] FOR FREE!
I'M SO [Proud] OF YOU, I COULD [Killed] YOU!
[InsertPlayerName]'S [Hyperlink] WAS [Blocked]!!
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME! I'LL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!
You never cease to surprise me.
Well, what can I say? I die hard!
[EXTREMELY LOUD INCORRECT BUZZER]
This is your final frontier!
Womp womp!
Don't worry, your stuff won't despawn!
No, the journey doesn't end here.
I am... inevitable.
Reincarnation in progress...
Death is just another path, one that we all must take.
It's past your bedtime!
You've made a grave mistake!
lol
There is no escape.
There is an image of death in every birth.
But still just OK...
I don't feel so good...
git gud
The Past still haunts you.
[LIFE SUPPORT: OFFLINE]
Body desecrated. You lost 0 Cells.
What, were you playing with a steering wheel?
Say pal, you don't look so good.
HIGHWAY TO HELL!
This is how you died.
sentenced to forever broccoli no candy
hrngh soup
But it refused.
The Phantoms have put you in a deep sleep.
Not with a bang, but a whimper.
Roll it again.
How abnormal...
... and so he vanished, another number among the missing.
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.
Don't try this at home!
Now it's time for another vendetta!
I always come back!
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.
Fear is the mind-killer.
VILLAGERS ARE DEAD THE NETHER IS FULL LAVA IS FUEL
All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
It's over, isn't it?
In the Exodus, no one can hear you scream.
28 STAB WOUNDS!
New life will be born beneath the blood stained sand!
Did you have lead in your hotbar again?
... and you get to tend the rabbits.
This truly was a Raspberry Flavoured!
Okay campers, rise and shine!
The only true death is to never live.
That's rough, buddy.
